- Complex arithmetic
- Matrix generation
  - Perspective

- Matrix-matrix multiplication
  - Basic use case
  - Of different data types (float/double/T) #if CONVERSIONS_ENABLED
  - Of different order (2/3/4)
  - Don't bother with mixed data type+order difference
- Quaternions
  - There is no implementation yet
  - Do not use an existing imaginary arithmetic library - should be self contained
  - Slerp - spherical linear interpolation is the main reason we want this
- Interpolation
  - Rational Bezier
  - Hermite
- SimpleMomentum2DDemo - correct angle for balls bouncing
- Clipping planes
