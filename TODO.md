## To Do

- Examine Arran's suggestions
- Capitals (XYZW and RGBA) for tvecs
- Line up names with GLSL better
- Simplify InlineData(values) rather than InlineData(new object[] { values })
- Commenting
  - ///<> for each class
  - ///<> for each method
  - ///<> for each property
- Use && on #ifs rather than nesting
- mat4.createCamera
- Documenting
  - README
    - Provide some examples
- System.Numerics.Vector compatibility
  - Compare feature set
- Benchmarking
  - Everything
- Demos
  - 3D Bezier curves
  - 3D bouncing ball
  - 3D particles (fireworks?)
  - 3D spinning box (needs Quaternion rotation)
  - 3D penny arcade demo
  - 3D FPS demo
- Clean up usings
- Add vec4.cross ("a vec4 mostly represents a vector in 3D space, and the w value is 0 if it's a direction and 1 if it's a position, because that determines whether it's affected by the translation part of a mat4 - if you're storing a vertex in a mesh as a vec4 (with w = 1), you might want to calculate the normal of a triangle with cross(p2-p1, p3-p1) - mathematically fake as hell, but convenient")
