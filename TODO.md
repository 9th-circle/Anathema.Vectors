## To Do

- Tests + Correction
  - Finish fvec3 tests
  - Literally everything except fvec2 and dvec2
  - Check a mat4 with a mat2 reference can access correct rows/cols
- Commenting
- Documenting
  - README
- Benchmarking
  - Everything
- Demos
  - 2D Bezier curves
  - 3D Bezier curves (needs projection matrix)
  - 3D boxes (needs projection matrix)
  - 3D particles (fireworks?) (needs projection matrix)
  - 3D spinning box (needs projection matrix + Quaternion rotation)
  - Euler rotation
- Double check permutations of removed preprocessor directives are sensible
